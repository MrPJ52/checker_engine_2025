TODO:

0. There was an error about promotion in game generated by ScoreFuction.run_game() in BoardTree.find_best(). Fix this, it seems that problem is in Game methods.

1. Implement minimax algorithm in BoardTree.

2. Promotion while attack and chain attack needs to be moved in attack() method, so that Bots can do the same.

3. Update game over condition in Game.game_over() method.

4. Create Learning AI algorithm.

5. (Potential bug fix) Fix error within move_debug() and attack_phase() method in Game class. It is not sure which part is broken(move_debug, attack_phase, find_targets, get_atk_dict), so it would be preceeded with debug play.
