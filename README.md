# checke_engine_2025

Checker Engine Project. A practice to proceed itself as chess machine later.

TODO:

1. Create read_board() method in Game class that gets board notation (either PEN or algebraic) and creates new game and board with it.

2. Create get_board() method in Game class that returns the checks' positions into algebraic notation.

3. Implement PlayerAI class.

4. (Optimization) Optimize print_board() method in Game class.
5. (Potential bug fix)Fix error within move_debug() and attack_phase() method in Game class. It is not sure which part is broken(move_debug, attack_phase, find_targets, get_atk_dict), so it would be preceeded with debug play.
